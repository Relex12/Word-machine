usage: word-machine [OPTION]

Generate words randomly from a statistical analysis of an input dictionary.

----------- Input and output options ----------
  -d, --dict FILE       specify the dictionary file.
  -a, --alpha FILE      specify the alphabet file (alphabet is deduced from the
                         dictionary if not specified).
  -w, --write FILE      write the processed dictionary in the specified file.
  -o, --output FILE     write generated words in the specified file.

----------- Dictionary processing options ----------
  -f, --force           remove from the dictionary every word with at least
                         one letter not in the alphabet (ignored if --alpha
                         is absent).
  --low-case            lowercase every word from the dictionary.
  --print-acronyms      print acronyms from the dictionary to stdout.
  --print-plural LANG   print to sdout the plural words whose singular is in
                         the dictionary (depends on the language, only FR is
                         available yet).
  --no-acronyms         remove acronyms from the dictionary.
  --no-plural LANG      remove plural words from the dictionary.

----------- Word generation options ----------
  -g, --gen NUM         generate as many words as specified (option required
                         for every option below).
  --dim NUM             use the specified dimension for the matrix (between 2
                         and 3).
  --capitalize          capitalize generated words.
  -s, --size SIZE       specify the length of generated words. SIZE can be
                         NUM      (equals)
                         NUM:     (less than)
                         :NUM     (more than).
                         NUM:NUM  (between)
  --prefix STR          specify STR as a prefix for all generated words.
  -n, --new             generate words that are not in the dictionary.

----------- Miscellaneous options ----------
  -h, --help            print this help and exit.
  -v, --version         print version and exit.

----------- Input files specifications ----------

  The dictionary file must always be specified. It must be represented as a
   carriage return separated list. There should be no space between the word
   and the carriage return character. LF and CRLF distinction should not be a
   problem. There is no need to order the words. Duplicated words are counted
   only once.

  The alphabet file is not required, but can be used if you want to remove from
   the dictionary words that contain specific letters. The file must contain
   every character that can be in the dictionary words. The alphabet file must
   be written as a single-space separated list of characters. There must be a
   space after the final character. All the characters must be on the first
   line, without carriage return. Upper and lower case letters must be both
   specified if needed. Each accent, digit or special character that is used
   have to be specified. Characters in the alphabet that are not used in the
   dictionary words are a small loss of memory, but the program still works.
   Characters from 'a' to 'z' and '-' are the often required.
